# Public assets

Place your branding assets here. The app will look for:

- `nhan-lam-logo.png` — shown in the header, login screen, and favicon.

Alternative: In Settings → Cửa hàng → Chi nhánh, you can set a `Logo URL` per branch; that overrides the default image.

Note: Vite automatically serves files in this `public/` directory at the root (e.g. `/nhan-lam-logo.png`).
